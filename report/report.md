Hello to you all dear OLS organizers! I wanted to summarize my project ones more and wanted to add my comments and the things that I couldnâ€™t compress within the presentation.

## 1.RESULTS

### 1.1 Graphs

First of all, I can start with the graphs and summarize here again;

**Graph 1 // Mentee Middle Cohort**

**Question 1:** OLS-3 program is helping me working openly


![Fig1](../figures/Data3_mid_mentee_1q.png) 

- 65% of the participants answered this question as very good. While 30% said good and only 4% answered as neutral. Although this question was answered with numbers (like out of 5), to be able to make a graph, I transformed that to very good, good and neutral.
